'paircomp' is entirely standalone; you don't need anything other than GCC
to build the C++ library & binaries, and you don't need anything other than
Python to build the Python libraries.

Configuration:

   * set the version/location of the Python installation you want to use
     in 'Makefile'.  (By default it uses whatever version is in your path.)

To build:

   * run 'make depend' (ignore any warnings)
   * run 'make'

To install:

   * make sure 'BINDIR' in 'Makefile' is what you want it to be.
     (By default it is set to /usr/local/bin.)

   * run 'make install'

After installation, you will have 'paircomp', 'seqcomp', and 'find_patch' in
BINDIR, and the Python library will be installed as module 'paircomp'.
